# mix-and-mingle-frontend

### A paragraph-long description (elevator pitch) of your project.
> Imagine spending an hour or more in front of a spreadsheet. You're tasked with randomly assigning a person within a group the size of a classroom (or bigger) to another person in the same group. You do this every week or so, on a regular basis. Knowing this, you could imagine how much time it takes for you to come up with different combinations, checking for no repeats of names, and accounting for an odd number in a group. Then can you imagine how much time you could save if there was a tool to do this work for you? With Mix & Mingle, you have it. Mix & Mingle is a random generator that takes in a mix of people and creates unique pairings to reduce time manually creating 1-on-1s.
